# Great job! Your revised code looks good and should produce the desired output. Let's walk through what you've done: Checking if the list is empty: You correctly handle the case where the line is empty by printing a specific message. Using a list to store formatted strings: You create a list called line to store each formatted string, which is an effective way to build the output. Looping and formatting: You use enumerate() to get both the index and the name, and format each entry as "i. name" using an f-string, which is both efficient and readable. Joining the list into a single string: You use " ".join(line) to concatenate all the formatted strings into a single string, which is then printed with the desired prefix. Everything seems to be in place! To further test your function, consider running it with different lists of names to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios. If you have any specific test cases in mind, feel free to try them out. Also, remember to check the official Python documentation for str.join() and enumerate() to solidify your understanding. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, platforms like StackOverflow can be a helpful resource. Keep up the good work!
